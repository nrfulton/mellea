"""Streaming generation with per-chunk validation.

Provides :func:`stream_with_chunking`, the core orchestration primitive that
consumes a streaming :class:`~mellea.core.base.ModelOutputThunk`, applies a
:class:`~mellea.stdlib.chunking.ChunkingStrategy` to produce semantic chunks,
and runs :meth:`~mellea.core.requirement.Requirement.stream_validate` on each

The orchestrator emits typed :class:`StreamEvent` objects that consumers can
observe via :meth:`StreamChunkingResult.events`.  Raw validated chunks remain

    validation_backend: Backend | None = None,
) -> StreamChunkingResult:
    """Generate a streaming response with per-chunk validation.

    Starts a backend generation with streaming enabled, consumes the
    :class:`~mellea.core.base.ModelOutputThunk`'s async stream in a single
    background task, splits the accumulated text using *chunking*, and runs
    :meth:`~mellea.core.requirement.Requirement.stream_validate` on each new
    chunk in parallel across all requirements.

    For each new complete chunk produced by the chunking strategy,
    `stream_validate` is called once per active requirement (in parallel
    via :func:`asyncio.gather`), receiving that single chunk.  Multiple
    chunks produced from one `astream()` iteration are validated
    sequentially in order, so early exit on a `"fail"` result prevents
    later chunks in the same batch from being validated or emitted to the
    consumer.

    If any requirement returns `"fail"`, the generation is cancelled
    immediately (via
    :meth:`~mellea.core.base.ModelOutputThunk.cancel_generation`) and
    :attr:`StreamChunkingResult.completed` is set to `False`.  The
    failing chunk is not emitted to the consumer; use
    :attr:`StreamChunkingResult.streaming_failures` to inspect what failed.

    When the stream ends naturally, any trailing fragment withheld by the
    chunking strategy (see :meth:`~mellea.stdlib.chunking.ChunkingStrategy.flush`)
    is released as a final chunk and run through `stream_validate` on the
    same terms as the regular chunks.  On early exit, the trailing fragment
    is discarded because the generation was cancelled mid-token.

    After the stream ends naturally, `validate()` is called on every
    requirement that did not return `"fail"` — both `"pass"` and
    `"unknown"` trigger final validation.  On early exit, no `validate()`
    call is made; :attr:`StreamChunkingResult.final_validations` remains
    empty.  Requirements are cloned (`copy(req)`) before backend generation
    begins, so the originals are never mutated and a raising `__copy__`
    cannot leak an in-flight backend task.

    The orchestrator emits typed :class:`StreamEvent` objects throughout
    execution.  Consume them via :meth:`StreamChunkingResult.events` in
    parallel with or instead of :meth:`StreamChunkingResult.astream`.

    Requirements that need context beyond the current chunk should
    accumulate it themselves across `stream_validate` calls (e.g.
    `self._seen = self._seen + chunk`).  They must not read `mot.astream()`
    directly — this orchestrator is the single consumer of the MOT stream.

    Note:
        Chunks are emitted to the consumer (via
        :meth:`StreamChunkingResult.astream`) only after every requirement's
        `stream_validate` has returned for that chunk.  A slow validator
        (for example, one that invokes an LLM) therefore adds latency to
        every chunk — the consumer sees a chunk at most as quickly as the
        slowest active validator.  This trade is deliberate in v1: it
        preserves the invariant that the consumer never sees content that
        has not been validated, which matters for UIs displaying generated
        text live.  A future fast-path mode that emits chunks to the
        consumer concurrently with validation (at the cost of that
        invariant) may be added if a concrete use case calls for it.

    Note:
        v1 retry is simple re-invocation of this function.  Plugin hooks
        (`SAMPLING_LOOP_START`, `SAMPLING_REPAIR`, etc.) do not fire
        during streaming — use :meth:`StreamChunkingResult.events` for
        observability instead.

    Args:
        action: The component or content block to generate from.
        backend: The backend used for generation and final validation.
        ctx: The generation context.
        requirements: Sequence of requirements to validate against each chunk
            during streaming.  `None` disables streaming validation (chunks
            are still produced; `validate()` is not called at stream end).
        chunking: Chunking strategy — either a :class:`~mellea.stdlib.chunking.ChunkingStrategy`
            instance or one of the string aliases `"sentence"` (default),
            `"word"`, or `"paragraph"`.
        validation_backend: Optional alternate backend for both
            `stream_validate` and final `validate` calls.  When `None`,
            *backend* is used for validation.

    Returns:
        StreamChunkingResult: A result object providing :meth:`~StreamChunkingResult.astream`
            for incremental chunk consumption, :meth:`~StreamChunkingResult.events` for
            typed streaming events, and
            :meth:`~StreamChunkingResult.acomplete` for blocking until done.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If *chunking* is a string that does not match any known
            alias (`"sentence"`, `"word"`, `"paragraph"`).
        RuntimeError: If the backend returns an already-computed
            :class:`~mellea.core.base.ModelOutputThunk` instead of a streaming
            one.  This indicates the backend is not honouring
            `ModelOption.STREAM`.

    Note:
        Any exception raised by `copy(req)` on a `requirements` entry
        propagates to the caller; no backend generation is started in that
        case.  See :class:`~mellea.core.Requirement` for the `__copy__`
        override contract.
