"""Async helper functions for managing concurrent model output thunks.

Provides `send_to_queue`, which feeds a backend response coroutine or async iterator
into an `asyncio.Queue` (including sentinel and error forwarding); `wait_for_all_mots`,
which gathers multiple `ModelOutputThunk` computations in a single `asyncio.gather`
call; and `get_current_event_loop`, a safe wrapper that returns `None` instead of
raising when no event loop is running. These utilities are used internally by backends
that operate in async contexts.
