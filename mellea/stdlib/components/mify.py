"""The `@mify` decorator for turning Python objects into `Component`s.

`mify` wraps an existing Python class or instance with the `MifiedProtocol`
interface, exposing its fields as named spans and its documented methods as
`MelleaTool` instances callable by the LLM. The resulting `MifiedProtocol` object
can be queried, transformed, and formatted for a language model without any manual
`Component` subclassing. Use `mify` when you have an existing domain object
(dataclass, Pydantic model, or plain class) that you want to expose directly to an
LLM-driven pipeline.

    Allows the object (or instances of the class) to be used in m sessions and with m functions.

    For the args below, only specify an _include or an _exclude of for fields and funcs. If both are specified,
    include takes precedence. If you specify the same item to be included and excluded, nothing will be included.

    If fields_include or fields_exclude are set:
    - the stringify_func will not be used to represent this object to the model
    - you must specify a template field or a template in the template_order field that handles a dict with those fields as keys
    - it's advised to use fields_include due to the many dunder fields and inherited fields an object/class might have

    Mify sets attributes on the object/class. If the object isn't already an mified/mobject, it will overwrite
    the attributes and methods of the object/class necessary for it to be mified.

    Args:
        obj: A class or an instance of a class to mify. Omit when using as a
            decorator with arguments (e.g. `@mify(fields_include={...})`).
        query_type: A specific query component type to use when querying a model.
            Defaults to `Query`.
        transform_type: A specific transform component type to use when
            transforming with a model. Defaults to `Transform`.
        fields_include: Fields of the object to include in its representation to
            models. When set, `stringify_func` is not used.
        fields_exclude: Fields of the object to exclude from its representation
            to models.
        funcs_include: Functions of the object to expose as tools to models.
        funcs_exclude: Functions of the object to hide from models.
        template: A Jinja2 template string. Takes precedence over
            `template_order` when provided.
        template_order: A template name or list of names used when searching for
            applicable templates.
        parsing_func: Not yet implemented.
        stringify_func: A callable used to create a string representation of the
            object for `content_as_string`.

    Returns:
        An object if an object was passed in or a decorator (callable) to mify classes.

        If an object is returned, that object will be the same object that was passed in.
        For example,
        ```
        obj = mify(obj)
        obj.format_for_llm()
