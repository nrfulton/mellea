    A chunking strategy receives the full accumulated text so far and returns a
    list of complete chunks ready for downstream validation. Any trailing fragment
    that has not yet reached a chunk boundary is withheld — it is not included in
    the returned list. Each call is stateless and idempotent given the same input.

    End-of-stream contract: ``split()`` always withholds the trailing fragment.
    When the stream terminates, callers are responsible for processing any remainder:
    take the full accumulated text, identify everything after the last returned
    chunk boundary, and handle it appropriately (e.g. pass to a final validator
    or discard).
