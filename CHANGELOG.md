* Improved documentation on model_options ([#134](https://github.com/generative-computing/mellea/issues/134)) ([`ad10f3b`](https://github.com/generative-computing/mellea/commit/ad10f3bc57a6cf68777c1f78b774414935f47a92))
* Explain that the tool must be called ([#140](https://github.com/generative-computing/mellea/issues/140)) ([`a24a8fb`](https://github.com/generative-computing/mellea/commit/a24a8fbd68b986496b563a74414f3fb8b1f02355))
* Fix typo on README ([#116](https://github.com/generative-computing/mellea/issues/116)) ([`dc610ae`](https://github.com/generative-computing/mellea/commit/dc610ae427f2b18008c537ea1737130e1f062a78))
* Fix README typos and broken links ([`4d90c81`](https://github.com/generative-computing/mellea/commit/4d90c81ea916d8f38da11182f88154219181fdd1))
