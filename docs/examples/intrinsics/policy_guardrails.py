"""Example usage of the policy_guardrails intrinsic.

Demonstrates how to use the Granite Guardian 4.0 Micro LoRA adapter
(policy_guardrails) through Mellea's intrinsic pipeline for scenario-policy compliance checking.

To run this script from the root of the Mellea source tree, use the command:
```
uv run python docs/examples/intrinsics/policy_guardrails.py
```
