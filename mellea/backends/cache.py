"""Cache abstractions and implementations for model state.

Defines the abstract `Cache` interface with `put`, `get`, and
`current_size` methods, and provides a concrete `SimpleLRUCache` that evicts
the least-recently-used entry when capacity is exceeded — optionally calling an
`on_evict` callback (e.g. to free GPU memory). Used by local HuggingFace backends
to store and reuse KV cache state across requests.
