"""Code interpreter tool and execution environments for agentic workflows.

Provides ``ExecutionResult`` (capturing stdout, stderr, success, and optional static
analysis output) and three concrete ``ExecutionEnvironment`` implementations:
``StaticAnalysisEnvironment`` (parse and import-check only, no execution),
``UnsafeEnvironment`` (subprocess execution in the current Python environment), and
``LLMSandboxEnvironment`` (Docker-isolated execution via ``llm-sandbox``). All
environments support an optional ``allowed_imports`` allowlist. The top-level
``code_interpreter`` and ``local_code_interpreter`` functions are ready to be wrapped
as ``MelleaTool`` instances for ReACT or other agentic loops.

    Code execution can be aborted prior to spinning up an interpreter (e.g., if prohibited imports are used).
    In these cases, the `success` flag is set to False and the `skipped` flag is set to True.

    If code is executed, then `success` is set to true iff the exit code is 0, and the `stdout` and `stderr` outputs
    are set to non-None values.

    We also use the `ExecutionResult` object to communicate the result of static and dynamic analyses. Those are passed back
    using the `analysis_result` field.

    TODO: should we also be trying to pass back the value of the final expression evaluated, or the value of locals() and globals()?

            execution was skipped.
        stderr (str | None): Captured standard error, or ``None`` if
