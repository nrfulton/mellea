    Intrinsic function that finds sentences in prior conversation messages and RAG
    documents that were most important to the LLM in generating each sentence in the
    assistant response.

    :param response: Assistant response. When ``None``, the response is extracted
        from the last assistant output in ``context``.
    :param documents: Documents that were used to generate ``response``. Each element
        may be a ``Document`` or a plain string. Strings are wrapped in ``Document``

        control, pass ``Document`` objects with ``doc_id`` set. ``Document`` objects
        without ``doc_id`` trigger a warning because the intrinsic uses ``doc_id`` to
        identify attribution sources.

        user query
