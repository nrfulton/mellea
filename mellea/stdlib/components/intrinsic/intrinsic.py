"""``Intrinsic`` component for invoking fine-tuned adapter capabilities.

An ``Intrinsic`` component references a named adapter from Mellea's intrinsic catalog
and transforms a chat completion request — typically by injecting new messages,
modifying model parameters, or applying structured output constraints. It must be
paired with a backend that supports adapter loading (e.g. ``LocalHFBackend`` with an
attached ``IntrinsicAdapter``).
