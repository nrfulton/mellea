"""`ChatFormatter` for converting context histories to chat-message lists.

`ChatFormatter` is the standard formatter used by mellea's legacy backends. Its
`to_chat_messages` method linearises a sequence of `Component` and `CBlock`
objects into `Message` objects with `user`, `assistant`, or `tool` roles,
handling `ModelOutputThunk` responses, image attachments, and parsed structured
outputs. Concrete backends call this formatter when preparing input for a chat
completion endpoint.
