"""Code interpreter tool and execution environments for agentic workflows.

Provides ``ExecutionResult`` (capturing stdout, stderr, exit code, artifacts, and
optional static analysis output) and three concrete ``ExecutionEnvironment``
implementations:

- ``StaticAnalysisEnvironment`` — parse and import-check only, no execution.
- ``UnsafeEnvironment`` — subprocess execution in the current Python environment.
- ``LLMSandboxEnvironment`` — Docker-isolated execution via ``llm-sandbox``, with
  ``copy_in`` / ``copy_out`` support via ``docker cp``.

Use :func:`make_execution_environment` to select an environment by tier name
(``"local_unsafe"``, ``"local"``, ``"docker_unsafe"``, ``"docker"``) rather than
constructing classes directly.  The top-level :func:`code_interpreter` and
:func:`local_code_interpreter` functions are ready to be wrapped as ``MelleaTool``
instances for ReACT or other agentic loops.
