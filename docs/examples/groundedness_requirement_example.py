"""Example demonstrating GroundednessRequirement for grounded response validation.

This example shows how to use GroundednessRequirement to validate that
assistant responses are fully grounded by citations to retrieved documents.

The validator implements a sophisticated 4-step pipeline:
1. Citation Generation - Generate citations using the citations intrinsic
2. Citation Necessity - Identify which spans need citations (LLM judgment)
3. Citation Support - Assess support level for each span (LLM judgment)
4. Groundedness Output - Declare response grounded iff all spans needing
   citations are fully supported

Note: This example requires HuggingFace backend with GPU (8GB+ VRAM recommended)
and access to the ibm-granite/granite-4.0-micro model.
