"""Abstract interfaces for sampling strategies and their results.

`SamplingStrategy` defines the contract for all sampling algorithms: an async
`sample` method that takes an action, context, backend, and requirements, and
returns a `SamplingResult`. `SamplingResult` records the chosen generation
alongside the full history of intermediate samples, their validation outcomes,
and associated contexts — enabling detailed post-hoc inspection of the sampling
process.
